## NVIDIA Jetson Nano Controlling LEGO Technic Power Functions' Motors and Servomotors
A total of 4 motors and a servomotor are controlled by the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Therefore, a [PCA9685](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver?view=all) is connected to the Jetson Nano via I2C, offering 16 PWM (pulse-width modulation) channels. Two motor bridges (or H-bridges), more specifically two L293D chips, are used to drive the motors/servomotor with the 9V provided by the 9V Lego Power functions system and the PWM control channels of the PCA9685. <br>
A detailed video description of LEGO Power functions cable layout, PWM control of the motor/servomotor, etc. is given in the following:

## LEGO Technic Machine
In a nutshell, the servomotor is driving a first wheel using a overrunning or freewheel clutch. This first wheel pushes banknotes from a provides stack of notes. A first motor drives a second wheel which accelerates notes towards a third and final wheel. This wheel (driven by second motor) feeds single notes to a platform where a webcam (Logitec C270) is taking images from the note at the right time. A classification model infers the type of bank note based on this input image. After the note is classified a conveyor belt is used (third motor) to move the note out of the machine. Timing of the motor/servomotor control and the inference is done on the Jetson Nano. [Here's a video of final machine in action.](https://youtu.be/MnLnOKctatg)

## Training a Banknote Classifier
Six different classes (5, 10, 20, 50EUR, Background and Counterfeit Money) are defined and more than 500 images for each of the categories are taken und used for training. 
The training data set is recorded under various lighting conditions, different backgrounds, angles and distances using the [camera capture tool](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/pytorch-collect.md) provided by the NVIDIA AI hello world tools. <br>
[Transfer learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-with-tf-2-0-ff960901046d) is used in the following; 
The model was derived from a pretrained (ImageNet) VGG16 network, keeping the base model weights frozen.
Three dense layers (25,10,6) where stacked on top of the VGG16's final convolutional + maxpooling layers. 
A softmax layer is used after the last dense layer to estimate normalized confidences for each of the classes. <br>
For training all input images are converted to 60x60x3 and a batch size of 5 is chosen, to allow training on the Jetson Nano hardware. Furthermore, the graphical mode is deactivated (sudo init 3) to free up additional GPU/CPU memory. <br>
During training the data is augmented using slight random rotations, contrast variation, zoom, and translations. Adam optimizer with a sparse categorical crossentropy loss is used.<br> 
[Tensorflow 2.x with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) is used from model training with a [95/5% split](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images) of training and validation data set sizes. 
After around 10 epochs (roughly 1h per epoch) a training and validation accuracies of more than 80% are achieved. <br>
Running more epochs with larger batch size, increased input images size and more advanced (and deeper) pretrained networks, will most probably result in better performace but would require dedicated hardware for training. <br>
An additional video documentation of the classifier training will be provided in the future. 

## Inference with the Banknote Classifier Model
The trained Tensorflow model is loaded and used for inference on video frames provided by the webcam. Due to the fixed focus of the used webcam (Logitec C270) a compromise between banknote size and sharpness in the recorded images had to be found. As a result the camera was mounted on a hand crafted LEGO mount approx. 20cm above the conveyor belt. A better camera with variable focus and zoom will most probable increase the performance of such a setup.<br>
An additional video documentation of inference examples will be provided in the future. 

## Banknote Counter - NVIDIA Jetson & LEGO Technic 
After initializing the PCA9685 library and loading the Tensorflow model, the following steps are performed by the Jetson Nano in a timed manner for each note to be classified
1) Starting motor #1, which will accelerate the note after it is pushed from the stack
2) Moving the servomotor left/right/, which will pushed notes from the stack 
3) Stopping motor #1, which will stop accelerate the note
4) Starting motor #2 only for a brief time span, which will feed a single note to the webcam
5) Image recorded from the webcam
6) Model inference of the banknote class based on the image 
7) Starting motor #3 to move the conveyor belt, which will transport the banknote out of the machine.
